Code from https://github.com/zhukov/webogram/tree/gh-pages

## Why this Repo?

Telegram is banned in several countries, in India Telegram is blocked on several networks including Jio and Airtel. So in this repo i will continuously provide new domains to access Telegram without compromising privacy or security of your data.

## Blocked URLs by Different Countries

* https://*.web.telegram.org
* `*` can be replaced with ["pluto","venus","aurora","vesta","flora"]
* `*` can be replaced with ["pluto-1","venus-1","aurora-1","vesta-1","flora-1"]
* I've added these APIs directly into base domain using Proxy and making it accessible via Single domain.

## List of Domains

* https://web.telegram.org (hosted on Telegram servers, Permanent Domain)
* https://web.telegram.ind.in (Works in All Countries, Please let us know if your country blocks this in future, we'll enable another domain name.)

## What it does?

* We've changed https://pluto.web.telegram.org to https://web.telegram.ind.in/api/pluto and same for all other URLs.

## Where to deploy

* Currently this App can only be used on Netlify as it is configured to used on Netlify.
* Deploying this app directly on any other platform will create known issuse and it'll not work at all.
